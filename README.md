- Welcome to GOOD BONES, a Medieval Un-Life Simulator.
- GOOD BONES is a game about otherness, hiding, and the decisions and compromises we often have to make to keep ourselves safe.
- GOOD BONES is also about finding yourself, community, trust, and the potential to live a fulfilling life in troubled times.
- In GOOD BONES, the player character, a reanimated skeleton, runs from an ominous duty necessitating their creation and trips into a pastoral life of deception, avoiding discovery (and subsequent destruction) with the help of capricious and powerful sprites.
- Will the player endeavor to gain the trust of the nearby town and build a new life alongside them, or will they follow the mercurial Fae to the ends of their whimsical schemes?
- Players will have access to farm simulator staples like crop and animal management (including beekeeping), building relationships with living human characters, and basic trade and foraging.
- Beyond this, players will be able to use various key cosmetic items to overcome story hurdles as they try to mirror humanity to their new peers.
- This game is currently in pre-production, and may not begin solid development until mid-2025.
- Thank you for your patience. I am learning how to use GitHub for this as well as my work as a molecular phylogeneticist.
- Please have something nice to eat today.
